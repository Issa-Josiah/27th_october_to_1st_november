        <h2>VS-CODE STARTUP AND CODING</h2>
        <p>In today session, ;it was all about interacting with the vs code with a little bit of coding.</p>
        <p> When we code we use html 5</p>
        <p>
            lets break it down.
            <br>
            html is the tag name
        -->it must have an opening and a closing tag.
        <br>
        After the tag we place the tag attribute. for example html lang=es-us. lang is the tag attribute.
        </p>
        <p>In writing the meta in html 5, there is the meta charset which is the utf8,
            the meta name which is the  viewport with content of width devicewidth of an initial scale of 1.0.
        </p>
        <p>The are also other variables like the meta name=keywords. to give the wording of the web.
            <br>
            also the meta description to give the description of the page searched. its representation is shown
            in the image below.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
        <img src="wednesday.png" alt="image of the viewing point of the topics" width="2000" height="alto">
        </div>
        <p>To write comment input ctrl and /</p>
        <p>To inspect the html code of any website right click and inspect. You will see a button that views the code.</p>
        <p>When you place the backgound color in the span tag the color is only placed in the word while on the 
            normal paragraph it is placed in the whole block. Example
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:yellow";><span style="background-color:brown;">welcome to the lesson</span> 
        <br>
        And this welocme to the lesson
    </p>
    </body>
